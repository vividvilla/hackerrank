# Solutions to [HackerRank][1] problems

This repository contains solutions to [HackerRank][1] problems, available at
[http://www.hackerrank.com][1]. These solutions are provided "as is". I give no
guarantees that they will work as expected. Please refrain from using my
solutions in the site.

## Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command,
replacing `<problem_id>` with the id of the problem you want to compile (see
section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible ids):

    $ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to
the next one, replacing `candies` with the id of the desired problem:

    $ candies
